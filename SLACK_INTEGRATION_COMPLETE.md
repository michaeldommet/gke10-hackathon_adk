## 📋 Implementation Summary

### 1. **Enhanced alerting.py**

  - ⚠️  **High**: Orange color for important alerts  
  - ⚡ **Medium**: Gold color for moderate issues
  - ℹ️  **Low/Info**: Green color for informational alerts
- Rich message structure with service details, timestamps, and alert context

### 2. **Environment Configuration**
- Updated `env.example` with Slack configuration variables:
  ```bash
  SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK

  SLACK_BOT_NAME=ADK Self-Healing Agent
  ```

### 3. **Kubernetes Deployment Integration**

- Tests all severity levels with mock webhook URLs
- Validates message formatting and error handling

### 6. **Documentation Updates**
